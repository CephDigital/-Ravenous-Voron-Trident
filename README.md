# Ravenous Voron Trident
An upscaled Voron Trident to use 3030 extrusions and 9 / 10mm belts. There are two main versions of this: a V1.8 variant that adapts the Rat Rig V-Core 3 Z axis with linear rods and a tradition Trident variant that uses the stock Z axis. There are also magnetic connectors for the panels to quickly remove them for open air or closed printing. Mine are scaled to have a print volume of 400mm^3.
